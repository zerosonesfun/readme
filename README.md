# About Me

> **“Is there a better way?”**  
> *Always forward-looking, always learning, always connecting the dots.*

![Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lean%20Six%20Sigma-Yellow%20Belt-yellow?style=flat-square)
![Project Management Certified](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project%20Management-Certified-blue?style=flat-square)

With nearly two decades of bridging people, processes, and pixels, I bring a unique fusion of human-centered strategy and technical craftsmanship to every project. I’ve guided organizations through talent acquisition and HR transformations with data-driven insights, deploying industry-leading Applicant Tracking Systems and Candidate Relationship Management platforms that hum with efficiency.

My Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt and Project Management certifications underscore a commitment to continual improvement—always asking “Is there a better way?” while keeping teams inspired and empowered.

## 👨‍💻 Digital Experience

Alongside building world-class talent strategies, I’ve been weaving digital experiences since 2005—crafting WordPress sites with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **PHP** long before many developers even heard the term “responsive.” For the last five years, I’ve extended that passion into custom plugin development, tailoring WordPress functionality to fit precise needs. I’m the creator of [upviber.com](https://upviber.com), a positive social bookmarking site that celebrates uplifting content, and the developer of Surfle, a playful Chrome Extension that turns bookmark and webring browsing into a delight.

> Some might call it a winding path—I call it **range**.  
> I’ve worn many hats across disciplines, and that breadth has become my superpower.  
> It’s what lets me move fast, translate between teams, spot the hidden patterns, and build what others didn’t think possible.

## 💻 Favorite Coding Languages

```diff
+ PHP
+ JavaScript
+ HTML
+ CSS

- React is impressive, but I dislike projects that require code compiling and 50+ dependencies.
